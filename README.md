# Chronicles

## Overview

The Chronicles app is a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework. It consists of two screens: the splash screen and the home screen. The splash screen provides an introductory view to the app, while the home screen offers functionality for creating new notes. The home screen in this branch is currently blank, and will be worked upon in the next branch.
